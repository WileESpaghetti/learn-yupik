Learn to Speak Yup'ik

The goal of Learn to Speak Yup'ik is to help people become fluent speakers of the Yup'ik language. Currently it
isn't much more than a simple flash card type application, but down the road I hope to add things like conjegation,
adding prefixes and suffixes to words, audio samples, and all the features normally expected from a "learn to speak"
type application. (including features to highlight what makes the Yup'ik language special!)
